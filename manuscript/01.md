# Strategic Domain-Driven Design

To make enterprise-scale applications maintainable, they need to be sub-divided into small, less complex, and decoupled parts. While this sounds logical, this also leads to two difficult questions: How to identify such parts and how can they communicate with each other?

In this chapter, I present a techniques I use to slice large software systems: Strategic Design -- a discipline of the [domain driven design](https://www.amazon.de/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1551688461&sr=8-3&keywords=ddd) (DDD) approach. 

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

DDD describes an approach that bridges the gap between the requirements for complex software systems and an appropriate application design. Historically, DDD came with two disciplines: tactical design and strategic design. Tactical design proposes concrete concepts and design patterns. Meanwhile most of them are common knowledge. Examples are concepts like layering or patterns like factories, repositories, and entities.

By contrast, strategic design deals with subdividing a huge system into smaller, decoupled, and less complex parts. This is what we need to define an architecture for a huge system that can evolve over time.

## Finding Domains with Strategic Design

The goal of strategic design is to identify so-called sub-domains that don't need to know much about each other. To recognize different sub-domains, it's worth taking a look at the processes automated by your system. For example, an e-procurement system that handles the procurement of office supplies could support the following two processes:

To use these processes for identifying different domains, we can use several heuristics:

- **Organizational Structure:** Different roles or different divisions that are responsible for several steps of the process are in indicator for the existence of several sub-domains.
- **Vocabulary**: If the same term is used differently or has a significant different importance, we might have different sub-domains.
- **Pivotal Events**: Pivotal Events are locations in the process where a significant (sub)task is completed. After such an event, very often, the process goes on at another time and/or place and/or with other roles. If our process was a movie, we'd have a scene change after such an event. Such events are likely boundaries between sub-domains.

Each of these heuristics gives you candidates for cutting your process into sub-domains. However,it's your task to decide with which candidates to go. The general goal is to end up with slices that don't need to know much about each other.
  
The good message is: You don't need to do such decisions alone. You should do it together with other stakeholders like, first and foremost, business experts but also other architects, developers and product owners.

A modern approach for brining the knowledge of all these different people together is [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com). It's a workshop format where different groups of stakeholders. For this, they model the processes together with post-its (sticky notes). 

## Domains are Modelled Separately

Another important aspect of Strategic Design is that each domain is modelled separately. This is the key for decoupling domains from each other. While this might lead to redundancies, very often it doesn't because each domain has a very unique perspective to its entities.

For instance, a ``product`` is not exactly the same in all domains. For example, while a product description is very detailed in the catalogue, the approval process only needs a few key data:

![](images/2019-03-04-10-15-14.png)

In DDD, we distinguish between these two forms of a product. We create different models that are as concrete and meaningful as possible.

This approach prevents the creation of a single confusing model that attempts to describe the whole world. Such models have too many interdependencies that make decoupling and subdividing impossible.

We can still relate different views on the product entity at a logical level. If we use the same id on both sides, we know which "catalog product" and which "approval product" are different view to the same entity.

Hence, each model is only valid for a specific area. DDD calls this area the [bounded context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html). To put it in another way: The bounded context defines thought borders and only within these borders the model makes sense. Beyond these borders we have a different perspective to the same concepts. Ideally, each domain has its own bounded context.

Within such a bounded context, we use a ubiquitous language. This is mainly the language of the domain experts. That means we try to mirror the real world with our model and also within our implementation. This makes the system more self-describing and reduces the risk for misunderstandings.

## Context-Mapping

In our case study, we may find the following domains:

{width=66%}

Although these domains should be as self-contained as possible, they still have to interact occasionally. Let's assume the ``Ordering`` domain for placing orders needs to interact with the ``Catalogue `` domain and a connected ERP system.

To define how these domains interact, we create a context map:


{width=66%}
![](images/2019-03-04-10-26-54.png)


In principle, ``Ordering`` could have full access to ``Catalog``. In this case, however, the domains aren't decoupled anymore and a change in ``Catalog`` could break ``Ordering``.

Strategic design defines several ways for dealing with such situations. For instance, in the context map shown above, ``Catalog`` offers an API (DDD calls it an ``open/host service``) that exposes only selected aspects for other domains. This API should be stable and backwards-compatible to prevent breaking other domains. Everything else is hidden behind this API and hence can be changed easily.

Since we cannot control the ERP system, ``Ordering`` uses a so-called anti-corruption layer (ACR) to access it. All calls to the ERP system are tunneled by this ACR. Hence, if something changes in the ERP system, we only need to update the ACR. Also, the ACR allows us to translate concepts from the ERP system into entities that make sense within our bounded context.

An existing system, like the shown ERP system, usually does not follow the idea of the bounded context. Instead, it contains several logical and intermingled ones.

Another strategy I want to stress here is ``Separate Ways``. Specific tasks, like calculating VAT, could be separately implemented in several domains:

{width=66%}

At first sight, this seems awkward because it leads to code redundancies and hence breaks the DRY principle (don't repeat yourself). Nevertheless, it can come in handy because it prevents a dependency on a shared library. Although preventing redundant code is important, limiting dependencies is vital because each dependency increases the overall complexity. Also, the more dependencies we have the more likely are breaking changes when individual parts of our system evolve. Hence, it's good first to evaluate whether an additional dependency is truly needed.

## Conclusion

Strategic design is about identifying loosely-coupled sub-domains. In each domain, we find ubiquitous language and concepts that only make sense within the domain's bounded context. A context map shows how those domains interact.

In the next chapter, we'll see we can implement those domains with Angular using an [Nx](https://nx.dev/)-based monorepo.
