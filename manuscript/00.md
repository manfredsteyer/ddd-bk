# Introduction

Over the last years, I've helped numerous companies with implementing large-scale enterprise applications with Angular. 

One vital aspect is decomposing the system into smaller modules to reduce complexity. However, if this results in countless small modules which are too intermingled, you haven't exactly made progress. If everything depends on everything else, you can't easily change or extend your system without breaking other parts. 

Domain-driven design, especially strategic design, helps. Also, strategic design can be the foundation for building micro frontends.

Another topics I'm adding to this edition of the book is the new NGRX Signal Store. It's lightweight, fully Signal-based and highly extensible. However, it also changes some rules known from the Redux-based world.

This book, which builds on several of my blogposts about Angular, DDD, and micro frontends, explains how to use these ideas.

If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out at ``manfred.steyer@angulararchitects.io``. You also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/manfred.steyer). Let's stay in touch for updates about my work on Angular for enterprise-scale applications!

## Structure of This Book

This book is subdivided into 20 chapters grouped to four parts discussing different aspects of your architecture.

_Part 1: Strategic Design with Nx and Sheriff_

This part introduces an reference architecture acting as the leading theory of our work. This architecture can be adapted to different needs. In this first part, it's implemented using an Nx monorepo and Sheriff.

Chapters in part 1:

- Strategic Domain-Driven Design
- Architectures with Sheriff and Standalone Components .
- Build Performance with Nx
- Nx & Sheriff - Friends for Life

_Part 2: Micro Frontends with Federation_

Here we discuss how different domains can be implemented using Micro Frontends. For this, we look into several aspects of Module Federation and discuss the new tooling-agnostic Native Federation.

Chapters in part 2:

- From Domains to Micro Frontends
- The Micro Frontend Revolution: Using Module Federation with Angular
- Dynamic Module Federation
- Plugin Systems with Module Federation: Building An Extensible Workflow Designer 
- Using Module Federation with Nx Monorepos and Angular
- Dealing with Version Mismatches in Module Federation
- Multi-Framework and -Version Micro Frontends with Module Federation
- Pitfalls with Module Federation and Angular .
- Module Federation with Angularâ€™s Standalone Components
- From Module Federation to esbuild and Native Federation .

_Part 3: State Management with the new NGRX Signal Store_

Most Angular applications need to preserve some state. The new NGRX Signal Store is a lightweight and highly extensible state management solution we see a lot of potential in. This part shows how it works, how it can be extended to cover repeating requirements, and how it fits your architecture.

Chapters in part 3:

- The new NGRX Signal Store for Angular: 3 + n Flavors
- Smarter, Not Harder: Simplifying your Application With NGRX Signal Store and Custom Features 
- NGRX Signal Store Deep Dive: Flexible and Type-Safe Custom Extensions
- The NGRX Signal Store and Your Architecture .

_Part 4: Bonus Chapters_

The bonus chapters provide some further ideas and insights for your architectures. 

Chapters in part 4:

- Automate your Architecture with Nx Workspace Plugins
- The Core of Domain-Driven Design

## Thanks

I want to thank several people who have helped me write this book:

- The great people at [Nrwl.io](https://nrwl.io/) who provide the open-source tool [Nx](https://nx.dev/angular) used in the case studies here and described in the following chapters.
- [Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/thomasburleson?lang=de) who did an excellent job describing the concept of facades. Thomas contributed to the chapter about tactical design which explores facades.
- The master minds [Zack Jackson](https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy) and [Jack Herrington](https://twitter.com/jherr) helped me to understand the API for Dynamic Module Federation.
- The awesome [Tobias Koppers](https://twitter.com/wSokra) gave me valuable insights into this topic and 
- The one and only [Dmitriy Shekhovtsov](https://twitter.com/valorkin) helped me using the Angular CLI/webpack 5 integration for this.
