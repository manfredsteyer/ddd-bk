# From Domains to Micro Frontends

Let's assume you've identified the sub-domains for your system. The next question is how to implement them.

One option is to implement them within a large application -- aka a deployment monolith. The second is to provide a separate application for each domain. Such applications are called micro Frontends.

## Deployment Monoliths

A deployment monolith is an integrated solution comprising different domains:

This approach supports a consistent UI and leads to optimized bundles by compiling everything together. A team responsible for a specific sub-domain must coordinate with other sub-domain teams. They have to agree on an overall architecture and the leading framework. Also, they need to define a common policy for updating dependencies. 

It is tempting to reuse parts of other domains. However, this may lead to higher coupling and -- eventually -- to breaking changes. To prevent this, we've used Nx and access restrictions between libraries in the last chapter.

## Micro Frontends

To further decouple your system, you could split it into several smaller applications. If we assume that use cases do not overlap your sub-domains' boundaries, this can lead to more autarkic teams and applications which are separately deployable.

You now have something called Micro Frontends. Micro Frontends allow for autarkic teams: Each team can choose their architectural style, their technology stack, and they can even decide when to update to newer framework versions. They can use "the best technology" for the requirements given within the current sub-domain.  

The option for deciding which frameworks to use per Micro Frontend is interesting when developing applications over the long term. If, for instance, a new framework appears in five years, we can use it to implement the next domain.

If you seek even more isolation between your sub-domains and the teams responsible for them, you could put each sub-domain into its individual  repository:

However, this has costs. Now you have to deal with shipping your shared libraries via npm. This comes with some efforts and forces you to version your libraries. You need to make sure that each Micro Frontend uses the right version. Otherwise, you end up with version conflicts. 

## UI Composition with Hyperlinks

Splitting a huge application into several Micro Frontends is only one side of the coin. Your users want to have one integrated solution. Hence, you have to find ways to integrate the different applications into one large system. Hyperlinks are one simple way to accomplish this:

This approach fits product suites like Google or Office 365 well:

![](images/word.png)

Each domain is a self-contained application here. This structure works well because we don't need many interactions between the domains. If we needed to share data, we could use the backend. Using this strategy, Word 365 can use an Excel 365 sheet for a series letter. 

This approach has several advantages:

- It is simple
- It uses SPA frameworks as intended
- We get optimised bundles per domain

However, there are some disadvantages:

- We lose our state when switching to another application
- We have to load another application -- which we wanted to prevent with SPAs
- We have to work to get a standard look and feel (we need a universal design system).

## UI Composition with a Shell

Another much-discussed approach is to provide a shell that loads different single-page applications on-demand:

![](images/case-study-01.png)

In the screenshot, the shell loads the Micro Frontend with the red border into its working area. Technically, it simply loads the Micro Frontend bundles on demand. The shell then creates an element for the Micro Frontend's root element:

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'assets/external-dashboard-tile.bundle.js';
document.body.appendChild(script);

const clientA = document.createElement('client-a');
clientA['visible'] = true;
document.body.appendChild(clientA);
```

Instead of bootstrapping several SPAs, we could also use iframes. While we all know the enormous disadvantages of iframes and have strategies to deal with most of them, they do provide two useful features:

1. Isolation: A Micro Frontend in one iframe cannot influence or hack another Micro Frontend in another iframe. Hence, they are handy for plugin systems or when integrating applications from other vendors. 
2. They also allow the integration of legacy systems.

You can find a library that compensates most of the disadvantages of iframes for intranet applications [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microfrontend/common). Even SAP has an iframe-based framework they use for integrating their products. It's called [Luigi](https://github.com/SAP/luigi) and you can find it [here](https://github.com/SAP/luigi).

The shell approach has the following advantages:

- The user has an integrated solution consisting of different microfrontends.
- We don't lose the state when navigating between domains.

The disadvantages are:

- If we don't use specific tricks (outlined in the next chapter), each microfrontend comes with its own copy of Angular and the other frameworks, increasing the bundle sizes.
- We have to implement infrastructure code to load microfrontends and switch between them.
- We have to do some work to get a standard look and feel (we need a universal design system).

## The Hero: Module Federation

A quite new solution that compensates most of the issues outlined above is Webpack Module Federation. It allows to load code from an separately compiled and deployed application and is very straight forward. IMHO, currently, this is the best way for implementing a shell-based architecture. Hence, the **next chapters** concentrate on Module Federation. 

## Finding a Solution

Choosing between a deployment monolith and different approaches for microfrontends is tricky because each option has advantages and disadvantages.

I've created the following decision tree, which also sums up the ideas outlined in this chapter:

As the implementation of a deployment monolith and the hyperlink approach is obvious, the next chapter discusses how to implement a shell.

## Consequences of Micro Frontends 

Each architecture candidate comes with consequences: positive and negative ones. In our survey, conducted in fall 2023, we asked 153 practitioners about the consequences they observed when implementing this architectural style.

The goal was to get answers to the following questions:

- What benefits did practitioners observe, and how do they rate their positive impact?
- What drawbacks did practitioner observe, and how do they rate their negative impact?
- How did practitioners compensate for drawbacks, and how effective have the used countermeasures been?

These questions were broken down to several technical and organisatorical topics. The inquired questions have been subdivided into the following groups:

1. About the Interviewee
2. Project Context
3. Architectural Decisions
4. Perceived Technical Benefits
5. Perceived Organisational Benefits
6. Perceived Technical Drawbacks
7. Perceived Organisational Drawbacks

## Conclusion

There are several ways to implement Micro Frontends. All have advantages and disadvantages. Using a consistent and optimized deployment monolith can be the right choice.

It's about knowing your architectural goals and about evaluating the consequences of architectural candidates.
